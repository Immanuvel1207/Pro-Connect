# Pro-connect - Core Idea

## ðŸš€ What is Pro-connect?
Pro-connect is a **developer collaboration platform** that connects programmers, students, and professionals to find **project teammates, request help, and communicate in real-time**.

Unlike GitHub, **Pro-connect does not provide version control or file uploads**. Instead, it focuses on **networking and collaboration**, allowing users to:
- âœ… Register and create a profile with skills and college details.
- âœ… Post projects with descriptions and skill requirements.
- âœ… Search for developers who can help with specific skills.
- âœ… Send direct **recommendations** for teammates.
- âœ… Communicate via **real-time messaging** using WebSockets.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Pro-connect?
Many developers **struggle to find teammates** within their college or community. **Pro-connect** solves this by:
1. **Bridging the gap** between developers with complementary skills.
2. **Encouraging collaboration** without the need for Git repositories.
3. **Providing real-time chat** to streamline communication.
